  -> Used for error messages and network diagnostics, such as the `ping` command.

# Common path to valuable information

To check the current OS version in Linux, open the command line and use one of the commands like “cat /etc/os-release”, “lsb_release -a”, “hostnamectl”, or “uname -r”.

  `ls -la /home/[username]/`

  `ls -la /root/.ssh/ /home/[username]/.ssh/`
  `cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa`
  -> Lists SSH keys and authorized keys, and can view private key files.

  `cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
  -> Views SSH daemon configuration.

- **Logs**
  /var/log/
  `ls -la /var/log/`
  -> Lists log files available in the system.

  /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure
  `cat /var/log/auth.log   # (Debian/Ubuntu)
  cat /var/log/secure     # (CentOS/RedHat)`
  -> Views authentication logs.

  /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages
  `cat /var/log/syslog      # (Debian/Ubuntu)
  cat /var/log/messages    # (CentOS/RedHat)`
  -> Views general system logs.

 - **Configuration Files**
    /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/sudoers
    `cat /etc/passwd`
    `cat /etc/group`
    `sudo cat /etc/sudoers`
    -> Checks user accounts, groups, and sudo privileges.

    /etc/network/interfaces or /etc/netplan/
    `cat /etc/network/interfaces      # (Older Debian/Ubuntu)`
    `cat /etc/netplan/*.yaml          # (Modern Debian/Ubuntu)`
    -> Views network configuration.

    /etc/hosts
    `cat /etc/hosts`
    -> Views static IP address mappings.

    /etc/fstab
    `cat /etc/fstab`
    -> Views mounted filesystems and devices.

    /etc/crontab and /var/spool/cron/
    `cat /etc/crontab`
    `ls -la /var/spool/cron/`
    -> Checks scheduled tasks and cron jobs.

    /etc/rsyslog.conf
    `cat /etc/rsyslog.conf`
    -> Views system logging configuration.

- **Sensitive Application Files**
  /var/www/html/
  `ls -la /var/www/html/`
  -> Lists files in the web server root directory (for Apache/Nginx).

  /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  `cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf   # (Apache)`
