  -> Views authentication logs.

  /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages
  `cat /var/log/syslog      # (Debian/Ubuntu)

  -> Views general system logs.

 - **Configuration Files**
    /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/sudoers
    `cat /etc/passwd`
    `cat /etc/group`
    `sudo cat /etc/sudoers`
    -> Checks user accounts, groups, and sudo privileges.

    /etc/network/interfaces or /etc/netplan/
    `cat /etc/network/interfaces      # (Older Debian/Ubuntu)`
    `cat /etc/netplan/*.yaml          # (Modern Debian/Ubuntu)`
    -> Views network configuration.

    /etc/hosts
    `cat /etc/hosts`
    -> Views static IP address mappings.

    /etc/fstab
    `cat /etc/fstab`

    /etc/rsyslog.conf
    `cat /etc/rsyslog.conf`
    -> Views system logging configuration.

- **Sensitive Application Files**
  /var/www/html/
  `ls -la /var/www/html/`
  -> Lists files in the web server root directory (for Apache/Nginx).
